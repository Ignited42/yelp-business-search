# CPTS 451, Course Project: Yelp Business Search
This project is to fulfill the course requirement for CPTS 451: Introduction to Database Management Systems.
We are given a dataset from Yelp, consisting of various JSON files.  Each file contains information on businesses registered on Yelp such as their name, location and most importantly reviews on said businesses.  Our task is to create a basic search engine for the user to be able to filter the many businesses on certain criteria.

The dataset can be retrieved from the following link: https://www.yelp.com/dataset
